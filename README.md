### Version 0.0.3

This patch includes all the hacks from the previous one, along with the following:

- The toolbar may be opened or closed with a one-finger swipe down.
- The Lamy button, in addition to erasing when pressed, toggles the last two tools when clicked.

### Version 0.0.2

This patch includes all the hacks from the previous one, along with the following:

- New notebook name defaults to the current date and time (format: `yyyy-mm-dd_hhmmss`).

### Version 0.0.1

Our first patch, a pilot and proof of concept, is designed to bring back some
popular features for devices updated to version 3.x.

If you're still using a device with version 2.x, you might prefer using
[ddvk's Binary Patches](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-hacks).

This patch includes the following changes:

- The Lamy Pen button now works for erasing (only erasing for now).
  To use this feature, install
  [ddvk's Qt Plugin for Lamy Pen](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-stylus) first. You will not need to install ddvk-hacks like it recommends, as this replaces that dependency.
- The toolbar icon changes from the default open icon to a brush icon.
- The close icon (x) in the top right corner has been removed.
